# Portfolio Prep

In the first module of this course, you will build a personal portfolio site. This will help you establish a home on the web, and show off some of your software development projects and skills. Sometimes, the hardest part is getting the words right. To help you prepare for building your portfolio, you can start thinking about what you want to say now.


## Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

- A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.
- A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?
- Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
- What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.
- Gather your assets

## A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:

- A headshot of your wonderful face, approximately 200x250 pixels.
- A background image, approximately 1500x700 pixels.
- At least three screenshots of the best-looking parts of a previous project, like your Code 201 final project.
- At least three screenshots each, of two other projects you have worked on. Salmon Cookies? Odd Duck?

## Submission
- Create a new repository on GitHub, called portfolio-prep.
- In this repository:
- Use the README.md to organize and collate your information and notes.
- Upload the images that you’ve sourced for the portfolio.
- Submit a link to this repository.
